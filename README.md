# Where's Astro?

Where's Astro is a bite-sized LWC application that covers properties, decorators, fetching data with Wire Service & uiRecordApi, component communication using Custom Events & pubsub, and how to work with third-party JavaScript libraries.

# Getting Started
Run ./scripts/createOrg.sh (if on a Mac) or cut and paste its commands and run them individually (on Windows) to create a scratch org. It assumes you have already set a default dev hub.
